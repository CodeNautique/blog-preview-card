## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

```html
<h1><a href="">HTML & CSS foundations</a></h1> is better than <a href=""><h1>HTML & CSS foundations</h1></a>
```

### Continued development

To take the habits to initialize the css with :
```css
* {
  margin: 0;
  padding: 0;
}
```

### Useful resources

- [style.css](https://github.com/mci3x/QR-Component/blob/main/style.css) - This helped me for initialize margins and paddings in the CSS file.
- [](https://chatgpt.com) - It helped me to understand deeply the importance of block elements and inline elements in HTML file. The relation between parent and child in the CSS file.
